    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p> Go! by Kaneshiro Kazuki is a coming-of-age novel about Sugihara, a Zainichi student who falls in love with a Japanese girl. As a Korean living in Japan, Sugihara faces harsh discrimination by students and adults around him. <br>
    <br>
    Him and his friend, Jeong-il, frequently discussed about nationality form a scientific as well as philosophical perspective. For example, Sugihara argues that Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans share the same mitochondrial DNA, and that the discrimination based on nationality and ethnicity is pathetic (p.56).Sugihara concludes that as a Zainichi, he had to be educate himself and get stronger and forgive those who discriminate against him. However, when his girlfriend rejects him for being Korean, he is obviously devastated and struggles to find his identity. <br>
    <br>
    After reading Go!, we decided to unpack what it means to be Japanese to different types of Japanese people. For our project, we interviewed Japanese citizens and members of the Japanese diaspora across generational lines. <br>
    <br>
    We asked each person, "What does it mean to be Japanese to you?" And "Do you have a life experience that made you think about your Japanese identity?" <br>
    <br>
    Each person had a unique answer, however, we noticed that almost every person noted that if one does not fit within the rigid box of Japanese-ness set by Japanese society, they are easily outcast. Though our interview is somewhat limited right now, we hope to continue exploring and delivering the stories from various backgrounds</p>
